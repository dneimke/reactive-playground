    <h1>Observables</h1>

    <p>This repository is a place for me to learn about
        <abbr title="Reactive Extensions for Javascript">Rxjs</abbr> and using Observables.</p>

    <h2>Why Observables?</h2>
    <p>
        The broad adoption of web platforms and frameworks such as Angular and Firebase, has meant that Observables are fast becoming
        the preferred approach to dealing with data sources. Angular and Firebase both use Rxjs as their Observable implementation
        for the web. The flow-on effect means that we are now seeing that adoption spreading more broadly throughout the
        component ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/videogular">Videogular2</a> - a popular Angular module for working with Video uses a reactive approach which is also based on
        Rxjs. New frameworks which build on top of Rxjs such as
        <abbr title="Reactive Extensions for Angular">NGRX</abbr> are also coming to the prominence.
    </p>

    <h2>What are Observables?</h2>

    <p>The
        <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html">ReactiveX documentation</a> uses the following definition for Observables:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>An observer subscribes to an Observable. An Observable emits items or sends notifications to its observers by calling
            the observersâ€™ methods.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>An Observer implements 3 methods which the Observable can call into:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>next</li>
        <li>error</li>
        <li>complete</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You can create a custom Observer and pass it to the subscribe method of an observable to process events within an observable
        source.
    </p>

        Here are some of the resources that I used to learn Reactive programming in the order that I suggest consuming them in:

            <dd>A Pluralsight course by
                <a href="https://twitter.com/OdeToCode">Scott Allen</a> which teaches the internals of Observables and introduces operators and how to work with
                Observable streams of data.
